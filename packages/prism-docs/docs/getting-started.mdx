# Getting Started

Let's discover a **PRISM Facet in less than 5 minutes**.

## Facet Installation

Get started with **manual configuration** (if you need to leverage our embed API options).

Or **get set up Immediately** with **automatic configuration**.

In the following examples we show you how to implement the **Color Wall Facet**, however the `data-prism-facet` attribute can be set to any of our available facets! See a full list **here TODO**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="automatic" label="Automatic" default>
Paste the following code inline with yours, where you would like the facet to appear:

```html title="index.html"
<div prism-auto-embed
     data-prism-facet="ColorWallFacet"
     data-language="en-US"></div>

<script>
    (function(d, s, id) {
    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
    js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
    js.src = "https://prism.sherwin-williams.com/2.4.2/embed.js";
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
    }(document, 'script', 'prism-widget'));
</script>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual" label="Manual">
The following script needs to be placed before your application's scripts, likely in the head.

```html title="head.html"
<script src='https://prism.sherwin-williams.com/2.4.2/embed.js'></script>
```

Paste the following code inline with yours, where you would like the facet to appear:

```html title="index.html"
<div id="prism-embed-root" data-prism-facet="ColorWallFacet"></div>
```

To embed the facet, use the PRISM embed API. Below is an example of using the API to load the facet into the specified container. See embed documentation **here TODO**
```javascript title="index.js"
  (() => {
    window.PRISM.embed(document.getElementById( 'prism-embed-root' ), {
        // additional configuration properties would go here
    })
  })()
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Toolkit Installation

Add the following import statement to get the PRISM Toolkit CSS :

```javascript
import '@prism/toolkit/dist/index.css'
 ```

To install the Toolkit component library, run the following via command line:
```bash
npm install @prism/toolkit --registry https://artifactory.sherwin.com/artifactory/api/npm/sherwin-npm-virtual/
```
